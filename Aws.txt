Iaas:
it is a type of cloud computing service that offers compute storage and networking on demand

It is an infrastructure of cloud based technology 

API: An API is a set of rules and protocols allows one software application to communicate with another
     Here communicate means data    

SQS:
    1) Intro
        # Used to asynchronously decouple the applications (It will divide the single application to multilevel application)
    
    2)There are 2 Queue Types:
        Standard Queue Type , Fifo Queue Type
    
        Standard Queue: 
                # unlimited Throughputs (publish any number of messages)
                # low latency (<10ms on publish and receive)
                # Can have duplictate messages
        
        Fifo Queue:
                # Limited Throughputs 
                    300msg without batching(batch size = 1)
                    3000msg with batch (batch size = 10)
                # The Queue Name must end with .fifo for fifo Queue
    
    3) Encryption :
        # In flight(transit) using HTTPS API 
        # At rest server side Encryption
            SSE-SQS  ,  SSE-KMS
            
            SSE-SQS(Server Side Encryption - SQS):
                #All the messages in the queue are encryted automatically with SQS inbuilt keys
                #Easy to Maintain because without direct control over encryted keys
            
            SSE-KMS(SSE-Key Managment Service):
                #Here Messages in the queue are encryted with key provided by KMS Very Secure
                #Automatically rotation of keys and auditing(Involves in monitoring and recording)


    4) Access Managment :
        # IAM policies to regulate Access to the SQS API
        # SQS policies
            *Cross Account Managment(Different Aws Account can access our Queue)
            *Aws Services Access to Queue(Different Services will Access Our Queue)

    5) SQS Extended Limit :
        # To Send Messages larger than 256KB(limit in SQS)
        # For Larger Messages Store messages in S3 and send a message in the queue with a pointer to that file in s3(Java Library)
        
    6) Dead Letter Queue : 
        # An DLQ must be same type of SQS
        # DLQ use to store failed message proccessing in Main Queue
        # Redrive to Source (When mssgs are proccessed change to main queue) 
            

SNS:
    1)Intro :
        # Used to BroadCast Messages
        # Pub-Sub Model (Publisher will publish messages and Subscribers will Subscribe Messagess)
        # Instant Delivery (does not use queues)

    2) Encryption :
        # In-flight Encryption by using HTTPS API
        #
